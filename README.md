# EzDental

A project developed for my final year project. Built with Laravel 8 framework with the following functionalities :

1.  Manage dental prosthetic cases.
2.  New case registration and verification.
3.  Automatic technician selection for new prosthetic cases.

Main focus in this case study is as the following :

1. Allow multi level authentication with only one single page by providing middleware (5 user roles).
2. Provide example of route protection to avoid one user role to access another user roles routes.
3. Handling information sharing among different user roles.
4. Provide example of handling basic CRUD with basic UI developed with Bootstrap 5 and some front - end scripts for handling dynamic events.  
5. Allow one click  feature auto selection for assigning technician to new cases. This feature implements some data structure - Binary Search to allow faster iterations to search the best technician with the lowest possible workload.
